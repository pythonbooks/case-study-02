## Object-Oriented Programming

Write a Python script that implements following requirements:

Imagine that you are starting a new pizza restaurant franchise, and you'd like to be able to take online orders.

Create a Python class called PizzaOrder that has following capabilities.

1. Ability to store and retrieve customer first name and last name

2. Ability to store and retrieve the order date

3. Ability to store and retrieve the order amount (cost)

4. Ability to sort the order by order amount

In the code, you will create a order_robot function that creates 10 pizza orders using the class you created.

order_robot function will print each order detail (string representation) and will sort the orders by the order amount.
